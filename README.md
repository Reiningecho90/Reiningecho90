Hi, I’m Reinier Johnson, I am 14 years old

I’m interested in Python, Engineering, Neural networks

I’m currently working with hardware and software in python. My current projects include a discord bot which is being intermittently updated and I am working on getting my PCAP.

I'll be opening and closing some repos as I move onto different projects in the coding space, some of these projects are already open like my discord bot and a misc repo will be coming soon for a bunch of random projects.
