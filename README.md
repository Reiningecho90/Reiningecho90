Hi, I’m Rei Johnson, I am 16 years old

- Check out my GitHub Pages website for my free discord bot: https://reiningecho90.github.io/chances-discord-bot-public/
- Currently building a Python-based rocket simulation software
- I like coding small things and automating my life: https://github.com/Reiningecho90/personal-automation
- Currently expanding Rei Technologies! Visit us here: https://www.linkedin.com/company/rei-technologies-us

I'll be opening and closing some repos as I move onto different projects in the coding space, some of these projects are already open like my discord bot and a misc repo will be coming soon for a bunch of random projects.
